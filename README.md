### BDD
The project runs in the visual studio code. Download the jquery plugin from the jquery cdn then run it inside a script tag. Why was this framework chosen? With jquery, alot of javaScript functionality can be achieved with very few lines of code and in addition, it is very precise and easy to use and apply.

### Credits

Many thanks to w3schools documentation and freecodecamp for availing resources online. I found their resources very useful throughout the course of my project. Their efforts in availing the resources was very instrumental in the success of my project. I would choose them over again and recommend any individual to check on their resources whenever they'd want anything code related.
